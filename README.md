# Geometric Library #

## What is this? ##
The module allows you to calculate the area of a circle by radius and a triangle by three sides

### Using ###

Let's import it first:
First, import everything from the library (use the `from `...` import GeometryCalculator` construct).

The library has 2 functions:

calculate the area of a circle by radius:

        circle_area(radius)

calculate the area of a triangle on three sides
        
        triangle_area(side1, side2, side3)

Examples of all operations:

    radius = 5
    circle_area = GeometryCalculator.circle_area(radius)
    print(f"The area of a circle with radius {radius} is equal to {circle_area:.2f}")

    side1 = 3
    side2 = 4
    side3 = 5
    triangle_area = GeometryCalculator.triangle_area(side1, side2, side3)
    print(f"the area of a triangle with sides {side1}, {side2} and {side3} is equal to {triangle_area:.2f}")`
